# 2p-image-analysis
miscellaneous image analysis matlab scripts, for registering and de-interleaving 2-photon images 

These simple scripts depend on:
* Suite2p, https://github.com/cortex-lab/Suite2P
* NoRMCorre, https://github.com/flatironinstitute/NoRMCorre
* ScanImageTiffReader, https://vidriotech.gitlab.io/scanimagetiffreader-matlab/

The three packages will have to be checked out separately and put on the matlab path too. 

thank you:)
