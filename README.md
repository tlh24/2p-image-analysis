# 2p-image-analysis
miscellaneous image analysis matlab scripts, for registering and de-interleaving 2-photon imnages 

These simple scripts depend on Suite2p, https://github.com/cortex-lab/Suite2P

and NoRMCorre https://github.com/flatironinstitute/NoRMCorre

Both packages will have to be checked out separately and put on the matlab path too. 

thank you:)
